      "explanation": "Newton’s second law is a quantitative description of the changes that a force can produce on the motion of a body. It states that the rate of change of the momentum of a body is equal to both the magnitude and direction of the force imposed on it. Momentum, like velocity, is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction.",
